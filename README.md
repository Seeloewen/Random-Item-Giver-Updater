# Random Item Giver Updater

This tool allows you to add new items to the Random Item Giver Datapack by Seeloewen/Louis9. It simplifies the process of editing loot tables by providing a simple yet powerful user interface with lots of useful elements.
It is a rewrite of the older, less stable Random Item Giver Updater app.

The Random Item Giver Datapack, which is what the app is used for, can be found here: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/random-item-giver-datapack-1-0-0-minecraft-1-16-2

Currently, this app is not in a finished state yet it's already more powerful than the older app. A first (kinda stable) test build is expected this or next month. Alternatively, you can build it yourself by opening the project in VS 2022.
Please note that nothing is finished or even polished yet, so you will run into a lot of issues trying to use the app in the current state. You have been warned.
If you're interested, you can follow along the development on my discord server: https://discord.gg/pUGzCU2mk3
