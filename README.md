# Random Item Giver Updater

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Seeloewen/Random-Item-Giver-Updater/total?style=for-the-badge)

This tool allows you to add new items to the Random Item Giver Datapack by Seeloewen/Louis9. It simplifies the process of editing loot tables by providing a simple yet powerful user interface with lots of useful elements.
It is a rewrite of the older, less stable Random Item Giver Updater app.

The Random Item Giver Datapack, which is what the app is used for, can be found here: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/random-item-giver-datapack-1-0-0-minecraft-1-16-2

Currently, this app is not in a finished state yet it's already more powerful than the older app. A public beta build is already available for you to get a first look and feel and also for me to improve using your feedback.
Please note that nothing is finished or even polished yet, so you will most likely run into a lot of issues trying to use the app in the current state. You have been warned.
If you're interested, you can follow along the development on my discord server: https://discord.gg/pUGzCU2mk3
